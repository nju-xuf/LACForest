This is the official implementation of IJCAI 2025 paper "**On the Learning with Augmented Class via Forests**", and we include our proposed _LACForest_ and _deep neural LACForest_ approaches in this repository. 

+ For LACForest, please enter the “LACForest” directory and run “**python main.py**” to conduct our approach on dataset _segment_.
+ For DeepLACForest, please enter the “DeepLACForest” directory and run “**python main.py**” to conduct our approach on dataset _svhn_.
+ The running enviroment is summarized in "**environment.txt**".
